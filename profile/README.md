## 🧩 Overview  

Assassin’s Creed: Shadows for macOS takes you deep into the world of feudal Japan — a land of honor, mystery, and deadly precision. As a skilled assassin, you’ll walk the delicate line between stealth and strength, using shadows, strategy, and skill to dismantle your enemies and uncover secrets that shape the fate of an empire.  

This new chapter in the acclaimed saga delivers breathtaking visuals and fluid gameplay, perfectly optimized for macOS devices. You’ll explore a vast open world filled with castles, villages, and war-torn landscapes, each crafted with incredible detail. The combination of dynamic combat and silent infiltration creates a cinematic experience that rewards creativity as much as precision.  

Choose your path as either a master shinobi or a fierce samurai, each offering a distinct combat style and storyline. The world reacts to your decisions — weather, time of day, and environment all affect how you approach missions and enemies.  

Assassin’s Creed: Shadows makes full use of modern Mac hardware, delivering smooth performance and high-fidelity visuals whether you’re playing on Apple Silicon or Intel-based Macs. Every encounter feels personal, every battle has weight, and every moment spent in the shadows tells a story of power, rebellion, and legacy.  

This is not just an adventure — it’s a journey through loyalty, vengeance, and the pursuit of freedom under the rising sun.
